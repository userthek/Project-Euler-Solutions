 * General Formula:
 * - For an m√ón grid:
 * C(m+n, n) = (m+n)! / (m! * n!)
 * Straightforward Recursive Solution (Inefficient)
 * Approach:
 * - Base case: If we reach either edge (m=0 or n=0), there's only 1 path (straight line)
 * - Recursive case: Paths to (m,n) = Paths to (m-1,n) + Paths to (m,n-1)
 * 
 * Why it's inefficient:
 * - Exponential time complexity: O(2^(m+n))
 * - Massive recomputation of the same subproblems
 * Only suitable for very small grids (n <= 10-12)
